## BooleanAlgebra overview

Boolean algebras are Heyting algebras with the additional constraint that the law of the excluded middle is true
(equivalently, double-negation is true).

Instances should satisfy the following laws in addition to the `HeytingAlgebra` laws:

- Excluded middle: `a ∨ ¬a <-> 1`

Boolean algebras generalize classical logic: one is equivalent to "true" and zero is equivalent to "false".

# combinators

## reverse

Every boolean algebras has a dual algebra, which involves reversing one/zero as well as join/meet.

**Signature**

```ts
export declare const reverse: <A>(BA: BooleanAlgebra<A>) => BooleanAlgebra<A>
```

## BooleanAlgebra (interface)
